I've been updating the information over at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link covid19/index.md %}">my Covid19 page</a>. I thought you might want to know.

There is lots of useful information covering the basics
(what you should do, what does this mean) and also less immediately relevant
information. Hopefully that second category can be helpful around anticipating
what is coming next.
