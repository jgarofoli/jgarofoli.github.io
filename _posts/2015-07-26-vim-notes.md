# {{ page.title }}

Since this is a note place, I'll keep updating it.  See below for the change log.

### Other vimrc files

There are a lot of useful rc files out there.  A couple that I like some parts of are:

* [The Ultimage Vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).
  Many good things in here.  Is it too much?
* [Steve Losh's](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/d607caaf596b951d14f58d0a8342d2c2462372f6/vim/vimrc?at=default).
  Tries to send your copies to his webpage.  Messes with default copy behaviour.
  Nice, but does some fishy or annoying things.  Does a lot of things.
  This file also interferes with git's use of vi.

They each have their drawbacks.
There are also many nice color schemes.  I'll keep a couple listed here.

* [darkblue](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3131)
* [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).  Again, by Steve Losh.

### I always use these

Some other commands that I like to make sure are in my rc file:

```vim
" I like me cursor to move freely always
set virtualedit=all

" I use two spaces for indenting my python
" This gets undone sometimes, I'd like to find the culprit
" and make it stop.
set ts=2 
set sw=2

" Keep the cursor closer to the middle
set so=7

" line numbering
set nu
```
