Since this is a note place, I'll keep updating it.  See below for the change log.

### Other vim rcfiles

There are a lot of useful rcfiles out there.  Here are a couple that I 
used as sources for rolling my own.

* [The Ultimage Vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).
  Many good things in here.
* [Steve Losh's](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/d607caaf596b951d14f58d0a8342d2c2462372f6/vim/vimrc?at=default).
  Tries to send your copies to his webpage.  Messes with default copy behaviour.
  Nice, but does some fishy or annoying things.  Does a lot of things.
  This file also interferes with git's use of vi.

They each have their drawbacks.
They do many things that aren't to my personal taste
There are also many nice color schemes.  I'll keep a couple listed here.

* [darkblue](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3131)
* [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf),  also by Steve Losh.
* torte, if there aren't any installed
