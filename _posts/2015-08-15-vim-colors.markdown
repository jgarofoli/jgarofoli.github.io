I've hunted for a good color scheme for a lot of years, but only lately have
I been afforded the time to try and make my own.

A couple of good resources for learning about coloring in vim:

* [Vim documentation: syntax](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html)
* [Vivify](http://bytefluent.com/vivify/)
* [Vim Color Scheme Editor](http://lilydjwg.vim-cn.com/articles/vim-color-modified.html)
* [Vim Color Scheme Test](https://code.google.com/p/vimcolorschemetest/)

Since I am in the discovery phase of doing this, I'll just leave these links
here.
